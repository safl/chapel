bug: extern records lose unnamed struct fields with --no-remove-copy-calls

According to the copy of this test in extern/bradc/struct/, a C level call with
extern record type arguments should be unaffected by sending through Chapel
level code, even if the Chapel code does not have full knowledge of the struct's
fields.  However, autoCopy() calls do not respect this.  Thus, when the
optimization pass removeUnnecessaryAutoCopyCalls() is skipped, either
specifically or by throwing --baseline, this test will leave the unknown fields
default initialized and result in unexpected output.

Once this future has been resolved, this test should be removed and the skipif
for baseline testing of externFloat4calls.someFields.chpl should be removed.
